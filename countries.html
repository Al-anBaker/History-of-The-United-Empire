                                On the Day now known as Doomsday, The New missile system from The Old State Republic came online, however a software bug caused all Missiles to imediatlly fire at the Hexerian Capital
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                What followed was a Hyponic exchange killing almost everyone in the Hexerian capital except for a baby 'Alan', The now abandoned Old State Republic Capital was destroyed in the Exchange
                            </p>
                        </li>

                                The Republican General 'Schmeal' took his son 'Manat' with him to explore the ruined capital of Hexeria, there they found Alan saved by The Hyper Armour
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Schmeal decided to save Alan and take him back to The Old State Republic, where him and Manat would grow up as brothers
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                As the brothers grew up, Manat was chosen to lead an expidition to reclaim the Ruined Capital of Terra, Alan travelled with him as they set sail
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                As they got there Manat founded The State Colony, on the ruined rubble of the Old Capital
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                As the delegation returned to The Old Republic after the celebration, a new force 'Dr Dark' would sink the boat carrying the Goverment Leaders and burned the Capital
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Once Manat got wind of this news, he desolved The Old State Republic and the State Colony and Formed 'The State Republic' with Manat as Head and Alan as second in command

                                Hex commanded his army to take the poorly defended towns on the outskirts of the Republic, as the armies morale grew, Hex became increasingly cocky about winning the war

                                As the Hexerian forces got read to take The Great Bridge and seige the Capital, Intel came to Hex that the Bridge was heavily defended, Hex proceced to ignore the report, but would send a diffrent commander to attack the bridge

                                As the battle commenced it became quickly clear that the Intel was true and the Hexerain forces were being sent to their deaths, Hex retreated his forces, and personally retreated back to his castle

                                The truce was officially signed between the two nations, on the same day, Hex would succumb to his illness, two days later Kyle would die of old age

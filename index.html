                <h2>Book I: The State Empire</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>The State Empire</strong>, a new budding nation built by a peaceful <strong>Hex</strong> and <strong>Kyle</strong>, <strong>Hex</strong> wanted to cooperate with other nations surrounding the land, these other nations however, were not so interested. They pillaged and burned, everything the Ancient Empire loved. The children burned in their tears. <strong>Hex</strong> and <strong>Kyle</strong> were forced to reform <strong>The State Empire</strong> into a militaristic and strong State, During the war’s conclusion <strong>Hex</strong>, <strong>Kyle</strong> and <strong>Tyler</strong> were forced to flee the nation and build a new one, far away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hex</strong> never got over the betrayal that he experienced at the hands of the other nations, whereas <strong>Kyle</strong> was more pessimistic towards the other nations in the first place. As <strong>The State Empire</strong> rebuilt, new members joined and helped make a new, safe and free sanctuary for them to live, however, these new members called for an election, a choice for whom the leader of the Empire should be. <strong>Kyle</strong> decided that an election was in order. <strong>Kyle</strong> and <strong>Hex</strong> were the chosen candidates and the election began.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both sides of the election campaigned relentlessly to sway one more person to vote for them. As the campaigning stopped and the ballots were cast, the people had chosen whom to be their new leader for the future. This election started to divide the once close friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Tyler</strong> was the military commander of the Empire, he was a close friend of <strong>Hex</strong> when the Empire was first forged, <strong>Tyler</strong> joined on as a military commander and he was the leader of the army. <strong>Tyler</strong> loved the country, however as The Empire began to lose the war he became more disgruntled and depressed, he began to loathe the leadership of <strong>Hex</strong> and <strong>Kyle</strong>. <strong>Tyler</strong> was one of the first voices to call for an election, an election so that he could have a say in who could run the nations, however, once he realised that <strong>Hex</strong> and <strong>Kyle</strong> were the only names on the ballot he started to plan a Coup.

                <h2>Book II: State Empire: Treason</h2>
                <p>
                    As election night closed in, the ballots were finally counted and the new leader was ready to be announced, when <strong>Tyler</strong> walked up behind <strong>Kyle</strong> and stabbed him in the side. Silence fell and the world went quiet. <strong>Hex</strong> quickly pressed the emergency button and A heavily wounded <strong>Kyle</strong> and <strong>Hex</strong> teleported away. With both former leaders now missing, nothing stopped <strong>Tyler</strong> from ruling <strong>The State Empire</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the vault <strong>Hex</strong> and <strong>Kyle</strong> teleported into the stasis chamber, the teleportation cost almost killed both of them, and they then made their way into the hidden portal. They travelled to a hidden cabin thousands of miles away from the empire. <strong>Hex</strong> and <strong>Kyle</strong> quickly built up a small community and hid their items in a hidden chest buried deep underground, they donned rags and set out to reclaim the Empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hex</strong> did not take the betrayal of <strong>Tyler</strong> well, he was broken, how could <strong>Hex</strong>’s most loyal friends just stab <strong>Kyle</strong> like that, would <strong>Kyle</strong> do the same to him, <strong>Hex</strong> began to feel isolated and alone in exile, his friends, his home, his horse and his nation all stripped away from him like an arm was torn off him. <strong>Hex</strong> began to stop recognising his friends, he stopped seeing them as people, but as puppets, puppets toys for the leaders of the world to play with and he was one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Kyle</strong> took exile differently, he always hated being the centre of attention, the one to look up to and the one that everyone could depend on. During the exile, his mind began to heal, and his spirits lifted. Until <strong>Kyle</strong> noticed <strong>Hex</strong>’s rising insanity and his inability to make attachments and be happy. <strong>Kyle</strong> tried to help <strong>Hex</strong> but was denied at every turn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the empire <strong>Tyler</strong>’s power base rapidly declined, no one cared about remilitarizing and destroying other nations, they were sick of war and never viewed <strong>Tyler</strong> as a legitimate leader in the first place. As more and more people turned against <strong>Tyler</strong>, people started to scout out to find <strong>Hex</strong> and <strong>Kyle</strong> and see if they would help lead an oncoming revolution and retake the Empire. As they found <strong>Hex</strong> and <strong>Kyle</strong> the revolution grew and finally 300 days after the coup <strong>Hex</strong> and <strong>Kyle</strong> led the charge against <strong>Tyler</strong> and his loyalists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The battle was bloody and fierce, with many casualties on both sides. <strong>Kyle</strong> calmly retook the nation, whereas <strong>Hex</strong> loved to cut down people, he loved the battle, and he loved the control. As <strong>Tyler</strong> fell to his own blade after seeing the carnage rained upon him. <strong>Kyle</strong> retook the land and reformed the government. The nation took a new name, the Old State Republic. The flag was also changed so they could rid themselves of their militaristic past, however this dream of a brighter future would not last, and the war would come sooner than anybody thought.

                <p>
                    <strong>Hex</strong> and his growing insanity split the once close friends. During the revolution <strong>Kyle</strong> grew more and more worried over his friend's sanity, once the old Government fell and <strong>Kyle</strong> retook control he decided to not allow <strong>Hex</strong> back into government, <strong>Kyle</strong> deemed that <strong>Hex</strong> was a danger to <strong>The Republic</strong> as a whole, <strong>Hex</strong> was sent away, he was locked up. Because of the third betrayal, <strong>Hex</strong> snapped and ran away from the new Republic. He ran and formed <strong>Hexeria</strong>, a despotic kingdom that ruled its people like slaves. The 100-year-long war began at the moment <strong>Hexeria</strong> fired the first shot.

                    <p>
                        The War of Steel and Flesh, is the first major period of war between <strong>Hexeria</strong> and The State Republic. This stage used Conventional Warfare and had the least loss of life within this war.

                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            The Conventional War began just days after an assassination attempt was made targeting <strong>Kyle</strong>, this plot was foiled and tensions heartened between the two, in the coming days, <strong>Hexeria</strong> and The State Republic’s Army forces would grow massively. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the dawn of the last day of peace, both sides went to sit down and talk. What came of these talks was the Death of <strong>Hex</strong>’s main military advisor. It is unclear how he died but what is known is that cemented the face of the world for years to come.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Hexeria</strong>n forces quickly marched towards The State Republic, as both sides of the war were new to large-scale conflict, both <strong>Hexeria</strong> and The State Republic made crucial mistakes in the opening days. <strong>Kyle</strong> left a major town surrounded by mountains largely undefended, which let <strong>Hexeria</strong> march into the town with little resistance, once he heard the news <strong>Kyle</strong> vowed to never make a similar mistake.

                            The <strong>Hexeria</strong>n forces quickly advanced on The State Republic, exploiting the large fertile plains and largely undefended towns. As the <strong>Hexeria</strong>n force pushed in closer to the Capital, <strong>Kyle</strong> and a few others decided to secretly move the capital away from the force and set up a decoy at the old capital. <strong>Hexeria</strong> fell right into the trap and in the early dawn the Forces moved into the capital.

                        <p>
                            What occurred was a massacre, half a million men died at the hands of <strong>The Republic</strong>an Forces. <strong>Kyle</strong> felt sick at the reports of what occurred at Battle. <strong>Kyle</strong> retreated his forces away from the massacre, He sent out a message to <strong>Hex</strong> in order to end the useless bloodshed. <strong>Hex</strong> after the crushing defeat and worsening health problems accepted the truce agreement. <strong>Hex</strong> would later die, from varying health problems, Commander Schmeal would form a military dictatorship.

                    <h3>The Diplomatic War</h3>
                    <p>
                        As the truce, was more solidified, both side of the Conflict, began investing into new radical ways of warfare, this happened due to a leaked breakthrough from one of the top Magical Scientist of the State Republic, this breakthrough would lead to a new Weapon a power for one man to wipe all life off of Terra, They became known as “Hyper Weapons”. Hyper Weapons are an all encompassing name for the New age Weapons, these would include Plague Nukes, Hyper Conventional bombs and Fusion Rifles.

                            As Hyper Weapon, became more of a viable weapon of war, testing on both sides on seeing how useable these Weapons are used tactically on a battlefield, as these weapons were capable of Mass destruction on both sides, new Defences and Armour was needed to protect soldiers on the battlefield, the Armour would be a combination of Hyper Futuristic Armour with plasma shields, and a new alloy found only in the deepest pits of the earth this new Gold infused alloy would be called Darloriam.

                            As the new Arms race was heating up after the Capitol truce; new treaties were being signed between the two powers, these treaties cemented the idea that if any nation would use Hyper Weapons in war, the other side shall respond in kind ensuring that all will be destroyed. After the signing of MAE, the two sides would begin to work together, whilst having a gun pointed at each other's heads. This peace would last for 20 years.

                            Not all in <strong>Hexeria</strong> agreed with the MAE idea, as some saw extintion or at least somewhere close to it as a way to forge a new world in the hellscape that would follow a war fought by Hyper-Weapons.

                            Skytho during his later years after the Capitol truce, loathing the current Military government headed by Commander Schmeal, he saw Schmeal as traitors to the true cause, the fight of <strong>Hex</strong> and the war that rages beneath the surface. Given Skythos position in government he was able to manipulate many of the key people in Schmeal's cabinet into siding with himself, he would then hold a speech where he would get shot at, this incident would be quickly blamed on State Republic spies and Skytho could use this moment of weakness to Co-op the incumbent and install himself at a new eternal leader of a new more powerful nation.

                    After 100 years of war the Generals of the Old State Republic, desperate for one push, throw all of their men towards the front lines and push their way through the meat grinder. At last, there is a breakthrough and The Army of the Old State Republic surrounds and captures the remaining <strong>Hexeria</strong>n forces.

Returning to <strong>The Old Republic</strong>, the surviving citizens request to join <strong>The Republic</strong> and finally be free of slavery. Schmeal in his kindness allows them to follow and join him in freedom.

Their peaceful lives are overturned by a revolution, by the refugees of <strong>Hexeria</strong>, they were sick of being ruled and decided to finally rule themselves. <strong>Alan</strong>, <strong>Manat</strong> and the parliament flee their home once again and create a new safer republic, across the ocean.

                    Once <strong>Alan</strong> and <strong>Manat</strong> get to <strong>The Old Republic</strong> they find that the revolutionaries have burned themselves to the ground and taken the building and structures with it. <strong>Alan</strong> and <strong>Manat</strong> got to work rebuilding and fixing up the village. Once the work was done, <strong>Manat</strong> declared that this new land would be the First State Colony. Unbeknownst to him at the time an entity was moving in the shadows, this was a being with almost limitless power, his name was <strong>Dr Dark</strong>.

                        The Colony
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The delegation for the opening of the first state Colony departed the seas, on their trip back home. No one knew at the time, they never made it back and the State Republic was all but destroyed. Once <strong>Manat</strong> heard the news, he was heartbroken, however, he now had new responsibilities as the new President of the State Republic and as the colony became once again the capital of <strong>The Republic</strong>, refugees came over to seek asylum. The most notable of these people were: <strong>Petra</strong>, <strong>BueAeon</strong> and a new person named <strong>Dr Dark</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Walls were built to try and protect the new capital. However, while the walls protected the Citizens from mobs it did not do much for those against those living inside of them. A bandit, ‘Music’ raided the capital multiple times, and had even killed a horse named ‘Boris’ whom <strong>Manat</strong> became rather attached to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Late one night <strong>Alan</strong> and <strong>Manat</strong> were arguing over how refugees should be treated in <strong>The Republic</strong>. <strong>Alan</strong> argued that refugees were subhuman and should be a slave class to the more dominant leader class, whereas <strong>Manat</strong> argued that the refugees were just as human as the leaders, they both went to bed feeling rather fed up with each other.

                <p>
                    As the capital wakes up on a new day, they come to a shocking realisation two refugees have been murdered, <strong>Manat</strong> and <strong>Petra</strong> are quick to blame <strong>Alan</strong> for this and sign a warrant for his arrest. <strong>Alan</strong> is quickly locked in prison and is to await sentencing. <strong>Dr Dark</strong> appears outside <strong>Alan</strong>’s cell later that afternoon, he convinces <strong>Alan</strong> that if he doesn’t want to be executed by his “friends” then he should break free. <strong>Alan</strong>, terrified by the thought of death, runs away with <strong>Dr Dark</strong>, leaving the prison.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Manat</strong> and <strong>Petra</strong> walk to the prison and are ready to let <strong>Alan</strong> go because they found the real culprit, what they find is an empty cell with holes dug through the walls. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While on the run <strong>Dr Dark</strong> starts to manipulate <strong>Alan</strong> by explaining to him the great power he is to inherit, and that <strong>Dr Dark</strong> is ready to play his part in <strong>Alan</strong>’s reign. He tells <strong>Alan</strong> about the glory of the <strong>Hexeria</strong>n kings of legend and of the great Dark lord. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once <strong>Dr Dark</strong> and <strong>Alan</strong> reach the <strong>Hexeria</strong>n ruins, they start to rebuild the shattered village and the ruined castle, in the distance standing tall on a hill is <strong>Dr Dark</strong>'s tower. Once <strong>Hexeria</strong> was rebuilt <strong>Alan</strong> sent <strong>Dr Dark</strong> to go and capture refugees from the state republic and force them to work the <strong>Hexeria</strong>n lands as serfs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As <strong>Alan</strong> spent more and more time away from his friends, he began to lose himself and what he valued, he became ruthless, cruel and a monster, he forced hundreds of surfs to scour the depths of hell for any hint of the dark lord armour. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feeling lost and betrayed, <strong>Manat</strong> also started to lose himself, he became distant, and unresponsive to requests and left most of the nation ruling to <strong>Petra</strong>. However <strong>Manat</strong> was also spending his time researching an ancient power, the power to destroy, the power to kill, these were the super bombs of the 100 years war, <strong>Dr Dark</strong> while spying on The State Republic for <strong>Alan</strong>, helped with the nuclear program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Dr Dark</strong> often relayed information to <strong>Alan</strong>, however knowing that the state republic was developing nukes <strong>Alan</strong> became more paranoid and much more scared, until he woke up one late morning and snapped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Alan</strong> had every villager in his nation rounded up and shot, and he continued to kill as much as he could until it was just him and <strong>Dr Dark</strong>, <strong>Alan</strong>’s mental state broke him and the nation. <strong>Alan</strong> grabbed enough explosives to blow his whole nation to the moon, and once the charges were laid, he waited. 
<strong>Manat</strong> and <strong>Petra</strong> feared <strong>Hexeria</strong> would invade at any second and so they also prepared, they organised a division of citizens this division would protect the state republic.

                    The division led by <strong>Manat</strong> and <strong>Petra</strong>, decides to launch an assault on <strong>Hexeria</strong> and preemptively strike before an attack can happen. They find <strong>Alan</strong> holed up in his castle, lighters scattered the floor, fearing what was ahead only <strong>Manat</strong> and <strong>Petra</strong> enter the nation, they find an abandoned village, blood stained the village walls, and heads lay rotting on the now cursed floor. Seeing this sight broke <strong>Manat</strong>, as he was forced to witness what had happened to his friend.

                <p>
                    <strong>Petra</strong> finds a suspicious hole in the ground, she digs it up and, it’s TNT, she yells at <strong>Manat</strong> to get out of there, <strong>Manat</strong> listens, cries and walks out. Only <strong>Petra</strong> and <strong>Manat</strong> were to witness what remained on the broken land. <strong>Manat</strong> looks over to the castle and spots <strong>Alan</strong> lying at the doorstep of the castle. His head slumped over. <strong>Manat</strong> and <strong>Petra</strong> approach <strong>Alan</strong>, and they notice a small thin black wire, but- it’s too late, <strong>Alan</strong> lights the fuse and <strong>Hexeria</strong> and the castle goes white.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Manat</strong> wakes up in a daze, blood pouring down his head, he sees <strong>Alan</strong> walking around, confused, he is scared, and crying. <strong>Manat</strong> gets up and begins to walk over to <strong>Alan</strong>, <strong>Alan</strong> asks “W-who are you w-where am I”. He collapsed. <strong>Manat</strong> and <strong>Petra</strong> pick up <strong>Alan</strong> and take him back to The State Republic.

                    <strong>Alan</strong> was lost and confused, he didn’t know what was happening to him, <strong>Alan</strong> fell asleep again.
<strong>Alan</strong> woke up in his old bed in his old home, <strong>Alan</strong> stumbled out of bed his Fox ‘<strong>Lulu</strong>’ sat by his bed. <strong>Alan</strong> made his way downstairs and into the village centre, there he saw his friends standing around his door waiting to see his reaction.

                <p>
                    <strong>Alan</strong> stepped outside his house and looked at the people around him. “Who are you, people?” The nation’s folk looked at him angrily, they started to throw rotten food and berated him. <strong>Alan</strong> quickly ran inside and blocked the doors, he ran to the underground basement, into the quiet mushroom paradise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The state republic during this time was highly unstable, and collapsing. The people clamoured around <strong>Manat</strong>’s house demanding why they would let this monster back into their nation. <strong>Manat</strong> tried to calm the people down by claiming <strong>Alan</strong> was in no danger, but the anger only grew. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Manat</strong> who was unable to get control of the rapidly spiralling situation resigned from his position of power and therefore <strong>Petra</strong> would become the new head of state. <strong>Manat</strong> left the country, on a self-imposed exile, after seeing that not only his friend but also his nation turned on him, he ran into the woods and discovered a temple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With <strong>Petra</strong> in charge, the situation worsened, people already disliked her, because she was seen as a corrupt figure who bribed her way to the top. <strong>Alan</strong>, who was oblivious to what was happening around him, continued to work his life like normal, he tended to the farm and his home. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    1 month after <strong>Manat</strong> left, a riot broke out, a small one at first but it grew, the nation was fed up and something had to change, <strong>Petra</strong> in a desperate and cowardly move ordered the decision to fire on the protesters, the moment she made that call the state republic’s fate was sealed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Dr Dark</strong> became a prominent figure in the riot calling for a complete restructuring of the government and to adopt a more collectivist approach to the economy, he wanted communism. When <strong>Petra</strong> ordered the crackdown, the riot was organised and became the people’s revolution. <strong>Dr Dark</strong> was the leader of the new revolution and used his abilities in a way to push the revolution on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2 weeks after the initial riot, <strong>Dr Dark</strong> walked up the stairs of the National capital and killed almost everyone, the walls, floor and roof were soaked in blood, <strong>Petra</strong> was the only high-ranking individual to escape and leave the fallen nation, she would never forgive <strong>Manat</strong> for putting her in that situation. 
The Government would reorganise into the United Commune with <strong>Dr Dark</strong> as its head.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Manat</strong> had no clue what was happening to his nation, he spent many days reading the temple’s inscriptions and learning about all sorts of cool and magical spells. As <strong>Manat</strong> entered the temple for the last time we discovered something that blew his mind there was a way to prevent death and resurrect yourself, <strong>Manat</strong> became obsessed with resurrection, and he spent days in the temple trying to figure out what he needed to perform this spell and once he got it, he plunged his knife into his chest and began the process. Minutes later a man walked out of the temple, this man was not <strong>Manat</strong>, but someone different, he gripped tightly a totem in one hand and a blade in another, he was “<strong>Squares</strong>”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Alan</strong> tried his best to keep a normal life, but after the crackdown, the revolution came for him. The people marched down the streets and saw <strong>Alan</strong>’s home, they decided to torch the place and kill everything inside. As the house burned around him <strong>Alan</strong> ran out the back door and ran as fast as he could into the woods. <strong>Lulu</strong> was unfortunately caught in the flames. The house collapsed and every last thing in the house burned. <strong>Alan</strong> looked from the top of a nearby hill just outside the nation, he saw the flames and the smoke, and <strong>Alan</strong> for the first time collapsed in tears.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When <strong>Alan</strong> got up his head was clear, his memory had returned, he ran and ran until he found a village, he had found a mountain and carved his own home into it, he would remain there for the foreseeable future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After 5 months of the communist nation <strong>Dr Dark</strong> grew increasingly bored with the nation and decided to just leave and let it collapse, so <strong>Dr Dark</strong> left and wondered until he found <strong>Squares</strong>.

                    After the fall of the commune, <strong>Dr Dark</strong> went and found <strong>Squares</strong>, he fed into Square's lust and hunger for power and control. They, together built a new nation, born from their new twisted ideology, they named it “The State Order” an authoritarian state, much like <strong>Hexeria</strong> of older times. The process of building the state order was a slow one, as <strong>Squares</strong> and <strong>Dr Dark</strong> had to slowly manipulate a large population, these people became soldiers for the ever-growing army, and a vault was created to store all of the equipment needed for the war.

                <p>
                    <strong>Petra</strong> left the ruins and founded “The Swamp Village” a nice village in the heart of a swamp, this village was built on community, and other people would slowly join. <strong>Alan</strong> helped to build up the village near him, he helped the villagers learn a new way to grow and produce crops. In <strong>Alan</strong>’s spare time, he would visit the swamp village, and take part in festivals and celebrations, he also spent time building a camp, as a fail-safe, this camp was built in a Mesa area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 5 years of peace, <strong>Squares</strong> gave the go-ahead and sent <strong>Dr Dark</strong> to visit <strong>Alan</strong>.

                        Stage 2 was commenced by <strong>Squares</strong> and <strong>Dr Dark</strong>, this plan involved killing <strong>Alan</strong> and wiping out the entire Swamp village. In the state order, a new man would claw his way to second in command; his name was <strong>Prolonged</strong>. <strong>Prolonged</strong> was a minor military general during the late years of the <strong>Hexeria</strong>n war after he became the ambassador to Drageria, and so he was absent for the majority of the revolution. <strong>Prolonged</strong> believed that The State Order was powerful and he was loyal to the nation till the end. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Alan</strong> hid in a campsite several miles away, this campsite was built unknown to <strong>Alan</strong> next to an ancient buried library, this library held a hidden secret of legends and myths from even before <strong>The State Empire</strong>. <strong>Alan</strong> spent most of his time just reading and reading, he soon discovered the story of <strong>Hex</strong> and <strong>Manat</strong>.
After reading <strong>Alan</strong>'s goal became clear, he formed a rebellion named the “Remnants of Salvation” This rebellion would support the Swamp Village and the destruction of the State Order. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The State Order started to splinter, and rival factions began to form in the cabinet, the first faction was led by <strong>Squares</strong>, we wanted to keep pushing and take over every nation in the region, whereas the second faction led by <strong>Dr Dark</strong> wanted the war to stop.

                        As Dawn rose on the 51st day of occupation in the Swamp Village, many residents were losing faith that anyone would take down the order. Standing on a distant hill, <strong>Alan</strong> and <strong>Dr Dark</strong> planned out their next attack. They came up with a strategy that enclosed and destroyed the main army. And so on the dawn of the 52nd Day; the remnants marched down towards the village, they were 500 strong, and as they marched <strong>Alan</strong> was for the first time in a long time hopeful about the future of his world and for the future of The Remnants.

                        <strong>Squares</strong> who were touring the occupied land noticed something in the distance. At first, he thought it to be no more than bugs, however, his expression quickly turned to seething anger and hatred. <strong>Squares</strong> quickly grabbed <strong>Prolonged</strong> and ordered him to prepare defences, an attack was coming.

                            <strong>Manat</strong> lay dormant because he was terrified of his actions; he could not comprehend what <strong>Squares</strong> was doing in his body. When the battle began <strong>Manat</strong> used this opportunity to finally fight back for control of his mind. Every death in the state Order ranks helped <strong>Manat</strong> push through until he watched his best friend, someone he cared immensely for, cut down by his hand. <strong>Manat</strong> was horrified, shocked and angry he pushed on knocking down Square's defences one by one.

                            <strong>Squares</strong> near death, is attacked by <strong>Petra</strong>, her blade does enough damage to finally trigger the totem's regeneration effect Allowing <strong>Manat</strong> finally to use this moment of weakness to cut through and kill <strong>Squares</strong>. <strong>Manat</strong> finally has control.

                            <strong>Prolonged</strong> and <strong>Dr Dark</strong> were ferociously fighting, they both understood that while the war was not about them they knew that they needed to survive. Each strike was desperate, a bid to survive. A thud was heard and <strong>Dr Dark</strong> and <strong>Prolonged</strong> looked over for a second and saw that <strong>Alan</strong> was dead, <strong>Dr Dark</strong> and <strong>Prolonged</strong> hesitated for a second before restarting the fight. <strong>Squares</strong> walked up between <strong>Prolonged</strong> and <strong>Dr Dark</strong> stopping the battle. <strong>Squares</strong> turns and faces <strong>Prolonged</strong>, he begs for death. <strong>Manat</strong> was in control, but he could not live with himself, with what <strong>Squares</strong> had done.

                            <strong>Prolonged</strong> hesitated, he looked up at <strong>Dr Dark</strong>, who gave him a silent nod. <strong>Prolonged</strong> looked down at <strong>Squares</strong> with sorrow in his eyes. <strong>Prolonged</strong> grabbed his blade and with one slice he ended the State Order and <strong>Squares</strong> where they stood.

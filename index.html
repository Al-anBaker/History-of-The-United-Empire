                <h2>Book I: The State Empire</h2>
                <p>
                    The State Empire, a new budding nation built by a peaceful Hex and Kyle, Hex wanted to cooperate with other nations surrounding the land, these other nations however, were not so interested. They pillaged and burned, everything the Ancient Empire loved. The children burned in their tears. Hex and Kyle were forced to reform The State Empire into a militaristic and strong State, During the war’s conclusion Hex, Kyle and Tyler were forced to flee the nation and build a new one, far away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hex never got over the betrayal that he experienced at the hands of the other nations, whereas Kyle was more pessimistic towards the other nations in the first place. As The State Empire rebuilt, new members joined and helped make a new, safe and free sanctuary for them to live, however, these new members called for an election, a choice for whom the leader of the Empire should be. Kyle decided that an election was in order. Kyle and Hex were the chosen candidates and the election began.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both sides of the election campaigned relentlessly to sway one more person to vote for them. As the campaigning stopped and the ballots were cast, the people had chosen whom to be their new leader for the future. This election started to divide the once close friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tyler was the military commander of the Empire, he was a close friend of Hex when the Empire was first forged, Tyler joined on as a military commander and he was the leader of the army. Tyler loved the country, however as The Empire began to lose the war he became more disgruntled and depressed, he began to loathe the leadership of Hex and Kyle. Tyler was one of the first voices to call for an election, an election so that he could have a say in who could run the nations, however, once he realised that Hex and Kyle were the only names on the ballot he started to plan a Coup.

                <h2>Book II: State Empire: Treason</h2>
                <p>
                    As election night closed in, the ballots were finally counted and the new leader was ready to be announced, when Tyler walked up behind Kyle and stabbed him in the side. Silence fell and the world went quiet. Hex quickly pressed the emergency button and A heavily wounded Kyle and Hex teleported away. With both former leaders now missing, nothing stopped Tyler from ruling the State Empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the vault Hex and Kyle teleported into the stasis chamber, the teleportation cost almost killed both of them, and they then made their way into the hidden portal. They travelled to a hidden cabin thousands of miles away from the empire. Hex and Kyle quickly built up a small community and hid their items in a hidden chest buried deep underground, they donned rags and set out to reclaim the Empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hex did not take the betrayal of Tyler well, he was broken, how could Hex’s most loyal friends just stab Kyle like that, would Kyle do the same to him, Hex began to feel isolated and alone in exile, his friends, his home, his horse and his nation all stripped away from him like an arm was torn off him. Hex began to stop recognising his friends, he stopped seeing them as people, but as puppets, puppets toys for the leaders of the world to play with and he was one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kyle took exile differently, he always hated being the centre of attention, the one to look up to and the one that everyone could depend on. During the exile, his mind began to heal, and his spirits lifted. Until Kyle noticed Hex’s rising insanity and his inability to make attachments and be happy. Kyle tried to help Hex but was denied at every turn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the empire Tyler’s power base rapidly declined, no one cared about remilitarizing and destroying other nations, they were sick of war and never viewed Tyler as a legitimate leader in the first place. As more and more people turned against Tyler, people started to scout out to find Hex and Kyle and see if they would help lead an oncoming revolution and retake the Empire. As they found Hex and Kyle the revolution grew and finally 300 days after the coup Hex and Kyle led the charge against Tyler and his loyalists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The battle was bloody and fierce, with many casualties on both sides. Kyle calmly retook the nation, whereas Hex loved to cut down people, he loved the battle, and he loved the control. As Tyler fell to his own blade after seeing the carnage rained upon him. Kyle retook the land and reformed the government. The nation took a new name, the Old State Republic. The flag was also changed so they could rid themselves of their militaristic past, however this dream of a brighter future would not last, and the war would come sooner than anybody thought.

                <h2>Book III: 100 Years of War</h2>
                <p>
                    Hex and his growing insanity split the once close friends. During the revolution Kyle grew more and more worried over his friend's sanity, once the old Government fell and Kyle retook control he decided to not allow Hex back into government, Kyle deemed that Hex was a danger to the Republic as a whole, Hex was sent away, he was locked up. Because of the third betrayal, Hex snapped and ran away from the new Republic. He ran and formed Hexeria, a despotic kingdom that ruled its people like slaves. The 100-year-long war began at the moment Hexeria fired the first shot.

                    <h3>The War of Flesh and Steel</h3>
                    <p>
                        The War of Steel and Flesh, is the first major period of war between Hexeria and The State Republic. This stage used Conventional Warfare and had the least loss of life within this war.

                        <p>
                            The Conventional War began just days after an assassination attempt was made targeting Kyle, this plot was foiled and tensions heartened between the two, in the coming days, Hexeria and The State Republic’s Army forces would grow massively. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the dawn of the last day of peace, both sides went to sit down and talk. What came of these talks was the Death of Hex’s main military advisor. It is unclear how he died but what is known is that cemented the face of the world for years to come.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hexerian forces quickly marched towards The State Republic, as both sides of the war were new to large-scale conflict, both Hexeria and The State Republic made crucial mistakes in the opening days. Kyle left a major town surrounded by mountains largely undefended, which let Hexeria march into the town with little resistance, once he heard the news Kyle vowed to never make a similar mistake.

                            The Hexerian forces quickly advanced on The State Republic, exploiting the large fertile plains and largely undefended towns. As the Hexerian force pushed in closer to the Capital, Kyle and a few others decided to secretly move the capital away from the force and set up a decoy at the old capital. Hexeria fell right into the trap and in the early dawn the Forces moved into the capital.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What occurred was a massacre, half a million men died at the hands of the Republican Forces. Kyle felt sick at the reports of what occurred at Battle. Kyle retreated his forces away from the massacre, He sent out a message to Hex in order to end the useless bloodshed. Hex after the crushing defeat and worsening health problems accepted the truce agreement. Hex would later die, from varying health problems, Commander Schmeal would form a military dictatorship.

                    <p>
                        As the truce, was more solidified, both side of the Conflict, began investing into new radical ways of warfare, this happened due to a leaked breakthrough from one of the top Magical Scientist of the State Republic, this breakthrough would lead to a new Weapon a power for one man to wipe all life off of Terra, They became known as “Hyper Weapons”. Hyper Weapons are an all encompassing name for the New age Weapons, these would include Plague Nukes, Hyper Conventional bombs and Fusion Rifles.

                            As Hyper Weapon, became more of a viable weapon of war, testing on both sides on seeing how useable these Weapons are used tactically on a battlefield, as these weapons were capable of Mass destruction on both sides, new Defences and Armour was needed to protect soldiers on the battlefield, the Armour would be a combination of Hyper Futuristic Armour with plasma shields, and a new alloy found only in the deepest pits of the earth this new Gold infused alloy would be called Darloriam.

                            As the new Arms race was heating up after the Capitol truce; new treaties were being signed between the two powers, these treaties cemented the idea that if any nation would use Hyper Weapons in war, the other side shall respond in kind ensuring that all will be destroyed. After the signing of MAE, the two sides would begin to work together, whilst having a gun pointed at each other's heads. This peace would last for 20 years.

                            Not all in Hexeria agreed with the MAE idea, as some saw extintion or at least somewhere close to it as a way to forge a new world in the hellscape that would follow a war fought by Hyper-Weapons.

Given Skythos position in government he was able to manipulate many of the key people in Schmeal's cabinet into siding with himself, he would then hold a speech where he would get shot at, this incident would be quickly blamed on State Republic spies and Skytho could use this moment of weakness to Co-op the incumbent and install himself at a new eternal leader of a new more powerful nation.

                <p>
                    After 100 years of war the Generals of the Old State Republic, desperate for one push, throw all of their men towards the front lines and push their way through the meat grinder. At last, there is a breakthrough and The Army of the Old State Republic surrounds and captures the remaining Hexerian forces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The capital is raided and burned. The new leader Schmeal finds a baby called ‘Alan’. Alan was the heir to the kingdom of Hexeria, and the future of the nation. Returning to the Old Republic, the surviving citizens request to join the Republic and finally be free of slavery. Schmeal in his kindness allows them to follow and join him in freedom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alan and Manat grow up together, as brothers, they fight together, train together and learn together. Their peaceful lives are overturned by a revolution, by the refugees of Hexeria, they were sick of being ruled and decided to finally rule themselves. Alan, Manat and the parliament flee their home once again and create a new safer republic, across the ocean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In their new homeland Alan and Manat form a friendship stronger than any other, as they rise through the ranks, Alan and Manat are tasked with retaking the Old State Republic's territory. As they step on the boat and wave goodbye to their friends and family, they embark on the greatest journey in many years. In celebration of this Alan designed a new flag, one similar to the Old State Empire but reversed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once Alan and Manat get to the old republic they find that the revolutionaries have burned themselves to the ground and taken the building and structures with it. Alan and Manat got to work rebuilding and fixing up the village. Once the work was done, Manat declared that this new land would be the First State Colony. Unbeknownst to him at the time an entity was moving in the shadows, this was a being with almost limitless power, his name was Dr Dark.

Once Manat heard the news, he was heartbroken, however, he now had new responsibilities as the new President of the State Republic and as the colony became once again the capital of the Republic, refugees came over to seek asylum. The most notable of these people were: Petra, BueAeon and a new person named DrDark.

                    <p>
                        Walls were built to try and protect the new capital. However, while the walls protected the Citizens from mobs it did not do much for those against those living inside of them. A bandit, ‘Music’ raided the capital multiple times, and had even killed a horse named ‘Boris’ whom Manat became rather attached to.

                    <p>
                        Late one night Alan and Manat were arguing over how refugees should be treated in the republic. Alan argued that refugees were subhuman and should be a slave class to the more dominant leader class, whereas Manat argued that the refugees were just as human as the leaders, they both went to bed feeling rather fed up with each other.

                <p>
                    As the capital wakes up on a new day, they come to a shocking realisation two refugees have been murdered, Manat and Petra are quick to blame Alan for this and sign a warrant for his arrest. Alan is quickly locked in prison and is to await sentencing. DrDark appears outside Alan’s cell later that afternoon, he convinces Alan that if he doesn’t want to be executed by his “friends” then he should break free. Alan, terrified by the thought of death, runs away with DrDark, leaving the prison.

                <p>
                    Manat and Petra walk to the prison and are ready to let Alan go because they found the real culprit, what they find is an empty cell with holes dug through the walls. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While on the run DrDark starts to manipulate Alan by explaining to him the great power he is to inherit, and that DrDark is ready to play his part in Alan’s reign. He tells Alan about the glory of the Hexerian kings of legend and of the great Dark lord. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once DrDark and Alan reach the Hexerian ruins, they start to rebuild the shattered village and the ruined castle, in the distance standing tall on a hill is DrDark's tower. Once Hexeria was rebuilt Alan sent DrDark to go and capture refugees from the state republic and force them to work the Hexerian lands as serfs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Alan spent more and more time away from his friends, he began to lose himself and what he valued, he became ruthless, cruel and a monster, he forced hundreds of surfs to scour the depths of hell for any hint of the dark lord armour. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feeling lost and betrayed, Manat also started to lose himself, he became distant, and unresponsive to requests and left most of the nation ruling to Petra. However Manat was also spending his time researching an ancient power, the power to destroy, the power to kill, these were the super bombs of the 100 years war, DrDark while spying on The State Republic for Alan, helped with the nuclear program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DrDark often relayed information to Alan, however knowing that the state republic was developing nukes Alan became more paranoid and much more scared, until he woke up one late morning and snapped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alan had every villager in his nation rounded up and shot, and he continued to kill as much as he could until it was just him and DrDark, Alan’s mental state broke him and the nation. Alan grabbed enough explosives to blow his whole nation to the moon, and once the charges were laid, he waited. 
Manat and Petra feared Hexeria would invade at any second and so they also prepared, they organised a division of citizens this division would protect the state republic.

                    The division led by Manat and Petra, decides to launch an assault on Hexeria and preemptively strike before an attack can happen. They find Alan holed up in his castle, lighters scattered the floor, fearing what was ahead only Manat and Petra enter the nation, they find an abandoned village, blood stained the village walls, and heads lay rotting on the now cursed floor. Seeing this sight broke Manat, as he was forced to witness what had happened to his friend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Petra finds a suspicious hole in the ground, she digs it up and, it’s TNT, she yells at Manat to get out of there, Manat listens, cries and walks out. Only Petra and Manat were to witness what remained on the broken land. Manat looks over to the castle and spots Alan lying at the doorstep of the castle. His head slumped over. Manat and Petra approach Alan, and they notice a small thin black wire, but- it’s too late, Alan lights the fuse and Hexeria and the castle goes white.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Manat wakes up in a daze, blood pouring down his head, he sees Alan walking around, confused, he is scared, and crying. Manat gets up and begins to walk over to Alan, Alan asks “W-who are you w-where am I”. He collapsed. Manat and Petra pick up Alan and take him back to The State Republic. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alan was lost and confused, he didn’t know what was happening to him, Alan fell asleep again.
Alan woke up in his old bed in his old home, Alan stumbled out of bed his Fox ‘Lulu’ sat by his bed. Alan made his way downstairs and into the village centre, there he saw his friends standing around his door waiting to see his reaction.

                <p>
                    Alan stepped outside his house and looked at the people around him. “Who are you, people?” The nation’s folk looked at him angrily, they started to throw rotten food and berated him. Alan quickly ran inside and blocked the doors, he ran to the underground basement, into the quiet mushroom paradise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The state republic during this time was highly unstable, and collapsing. The people clamoured around Manat’s house demanding why they would let this monster back into their nation. Manat tried to calm the people down by claiming Alan was in no danger, but the anger only grew. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Manat who was unable to get control of the rapidly spiralling situation resigned from his position of power and therefore Petra would become the new head of state. Manat left the country, on a self-imposed exile, after seeing that not only his friend but also his nation turned on him, he ran into the woods and discovered a temple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Petra in charge, the situation worsened, people already disliked her, because she was seen as a corrupt figure who bribed her way to the top. Alan, who was oblivious to what was happening around him, continued to work his life like normal, he tended to the farm and his home. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    1 month after Manat left, a riot broke out, a small one at first but it grew, the nation was fed up and something had to change, Petra in a desperate and cowardly move ordered the decision to fire on the protesters, the moment she made that call the state republic’s fate was sealed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr Dark became a prominent figure in the riot calling for a complete restructuring of the government and to adopt a more collectivist approach to the economy, he wanted communism. When Petra ordered the crackdown, the riot was organised and became the people’s revolution. Dr Dark was the leader of the new revolution and used his abilities in a way to push the revolution on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2 weeks after the initial riot, Dr dark walked up the stairs of the National capital and killed almost everyone, the walls, floor and roof were soaked in blood, Petra was the only high-ranking individual to escape and leave the fallen nation, she would never forgive Manat for putting her in that situation. 
The Government would reorganise into the United Commune with Dr Dark as its head.

                    <p>
                        Manat had no clue what was happening to his nation, he spent many days reading the temple’s inscriptions and learning about all sorts of cool and magical spells. As Manat entered the temple for the last time we discovered something that blew his mind there was a way to prevent death and resurrect yourself, Manat became obsessed with resurrection, and he spent days in the temple trying to figure out what he needed to perform this spell and once he got it, he plunged his knife into his chest and began the process. Minutes later a man walked out of the temple, this man was not Manat, but someone different, he gripped tightly a totem in one hand and a blade in another, he was “Squares”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alan tried his best to keep a normal life, but after the crackdown, the revolution came for him. The people marched down the streets and saw Alan’s home, they decided to torch the place and kill everything inside. As the house burned around him Alan ran out the back door and ran as fast as he could into the woods. Lulu was unfortunately caught in the flames. The house collapsed and every last thing in the house burned. Alan looked from the top of a nearby hill just outside the nation, he saw the flames and the smoke, and Alan for the first time collapsed in tears.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Alan got up his head was clear, his memory had returned, he ran and ran until he found a village, he had found a mountain and carved his own home into it, he would remain there for the foreseeable future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After 5 months of the communist nation Dr Dark grew increasingly bored with the nation and decided to just leave and let it collapse, so Dr Dark left and wondered until he found Squares.

                    After the fall of the commune, Dr dark went and found Squares, he fed into Square's lust and hunger for power and control. They, together built a new nation, born from their new twisted ideology, they named it “The State Order” an authoritarian state, much like Hexeria of older times. The process of building the state order was a slow one, as Squares and Dr Dark had to slowly manipulate a large population, these people became soldiers for the ever-growing army, and a vault was created to store all of the equipment needed for the war.

                <p>
                    Petra left the ruins and founded “The Swamp Village” a nice village in the heart of a swamp, this village was built on community, and other people would slowly join. Alan helped to build up the village near him, he helped the villagers learn a new way to grow and produce crops. In Alan’s spare time, he would visit the swamp village, and take part in festivals and celebrations, he also spent time building a camp, as a fail-safe, this camp was built in a Mesa area.

                <p>
                    After 5 years of peace, Squares gave the go-ahead and sent Dr Dark to visit Alan.

                    <p>
                        Stage 2 was commenced by Squares and Dr Dark, this plan involved killing Alan and wiping out the entire Swamp village. In the state order, a new man would claw his way to second in command; his name was prolonged. Prolonged was a minor military general during the late years of the Hexerian war after he became the ambassador to Drageria, and so he was absent for the majority of the revolution. Prolonged believed that The State Order was powerful and he was loyal to the nation till the end. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alan hid in a campsite several miles away, this campsite was built unknown to Alan next to an ancient buried library, this library held a hidden secret of legends and myths from even before the State Empire. Alan spent most of his time just reading and reading, he soon discovered the story of Hex and Manat.
After reading Alan's goal became clear, he formed a rebellion named the “Remnants of Salvation” This rebellion would support the Swamp Village and the destruction of the State Order. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The State Order started to splinter, and rival factions began to form in the cabinet, the first faction was led by Squares, we wanted to keep pushing and take over every nation in the region, whereas the second faction led by Dr Dark wanted the war to stop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One night late Squares went to Dr Dark's home to sort their problems out amicably and reasonably, however, Dr Dark refused to yield his position Squares then became enraged and attacked Dr Dark. Dr Dark quickly gained the upper hand and knocked Squares to the floor. Dr Dark then ripped out his eye and replaced it with Squares. Dr Dark now had one of Square’s eyes and vice versa.

                        Once Dr Dark had left the State Order, it was up to Squares to get things under control, Squares and Prolonged without the worry of the opposition began their assault on the Swamp Village, many were wiped out and in fear, and many more joined the ranks of the State Order, however, some had run towards the Remnants base held out in Alan’s older base, these refugees explained the situation to Alan. Alan was shocked but also not very surprised, as he had been in communication with Dr Dark from when the war began. Alan decided that the time was right to bring Dr Dark finally into the fold and once and for all, destroy the State Order.

                        As Dawn rose on the 51st day of occupation in the Swamp Village, many residents were losing faith that anyone would take down the order. Standing on a distant hill, Alan and Dr Dark planned out their next attack. They came up with a strategy that enclosed and destroyed the main army. And so on the dawn of the 52nd Day; the remnants marched down towards the village, they were 500 strong, and as they marched Alan was for the first time in a long time hopeful about the future of his world and for the future of The Remnants. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Squares who were touring the occupied land noticed something in the distance. At first, he thought it to be no more than bugs, however, his expression quickly turned to seething anger and hatred. Squares quickly grabbed Prolonged and ordered him to prepare defences, an attack was coming.

                            History won’t remember where the first clash took place or by whom, but an eruption of violence exploded onto the newly formed battlefield. Many members of the Order were cut down in the early minutes of the battle, as they were unprepared for the true scale of the battle.

                            Both sides of the battle are fatigued and are at lower numbers with the remnants just slightly winning, that is until Squares feigns Alan and Slices him in the chest. Blood sprays out of Alan’s chest, Alan and squares fall to their knees, Alan looks on with sincerity and utters his last words: “F-Fight h-him, p-please, Squares I’m sorry.” Alan fell backwards, his corpse staring towards the blackened sky. Alan was Dead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Manat was locked in ferocious combat with Squares, a battle of determination, strength and intelligence. A battle for control over Square's new body. Ever since that cursed night in the jungle temple, Manat lay dormant terrified of his new existence, a white void surrounded him, it crushed him and clawed its way through Manat. Manat could see through Square's eyes but not interact, he couldn’t control anything about himself, trapped in his own eyes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Manat lay dormant because he was terrified of his actions; he could not comprehend what Squares was doing in his body. When the battle began Manat used this opportunity to finally fight back for control of his mind. Every death in the state Order ranks helped Manat push through until he watched his best friend, someone he cared immensely for, cut down by his hand. Manat was horrified, shocked and angry he pushed on knocking down Square's defences one by one.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Squares near death, is attacked by Petra, her blade does enough damage to finally trigger the totem's regeneration effect Allowing Manat finally to use this moment of weakness to cut through and kill Squares. Manat finally has control.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prolonged and Dr Dark were ferociously fighting, they both understood that while the war was not about them they knew that they needed to survive. Each strike was desperate, a bid to survive. A thud was heard and Dr Dark and Prolonged looked over for a second and saw that Alan was dead, Dr Dark and Prolonged hesitated for a second before restarting the fight. Squares walked up between Prolonged and Dr Dark stopping the battle. Squares turns and faces Prolonged, he begs for death. Manat was in control, but he could not live with himself, with what Squares had done. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prolonged hesitated, he looked up at Dr Dark, who gave him a silent nod. Prolonged looked down at Squares with sorrow in his eyes. Prolonged grabbed his blade and with one slice he ended the State Order and Squares where they stood.
